# Rocket WebGL
 A rocket that flies on an html canvas

I have not much future plans to maintain the project, but I can see some opportunities to create a game where you could dodge the orbs or have other enemies fly and shoot at you. All in all this is a very interesting small game that was created with WebGL and some basic libraries. Not with any engine.
